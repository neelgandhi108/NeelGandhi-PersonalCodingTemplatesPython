LeetCode 295 - Find Median from Data Stream [hard]

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example:

[2, 3, 4], the median is 3

[2, 3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
Example:

addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2

    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []  # containing first half of numbers
        self.min_heap = []  # containing second half of numbers

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if not self.max_heap or -self.max_heap[0] >= num:
            heappush(self.max_heap, -num)
        else:
            heappush(self.min_heap, num)

        # either both heaps will have equal number of elements or max-heap will have one more element
        if len(self.max_heap) > len(self.min_heap) + 1:
            heappush(self.min_heap, -heappop(self.max_heap))
        elif len(self.max_heap) < len(self.min_heap):
            heappush(self.max_heap, -heappop(self.min_heap))

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        # we have even number of elements, take the average of middle two elements
        if len(self.max_heap) == len(self.min_heap):
            return -self.max_heap[0] / 2.0 + self.min_heap[0] / 2.0
        # we have odd number of elements, the first element in max-heap is the median element
        return -float(self.max_heap[0])
