LeetCode 416 - Partition Equal Subset Sum [medium]

Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:

Each of the array element will not exceed 100. The array size will not exceed 200.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

2)Staircase (DP)

LeetCode 70 - Climbing Stairs [easy]

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note:

Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
--> 1 step + 1 step
--> 2 steps

4)Longest Common Substring/Subsequence (DP)

LeetCode 1143 - Longest Common Subsequence [medium]

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
